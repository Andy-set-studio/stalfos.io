    PRINT
    
    A very simple "wrapper" that allows you to add print specific styles within your css. 
    This is mainly in a mixin so that if anything changes in the future, we can just update this 
    mixin rather than refactoring our whole project.
    
    Usage example: 
    
    body {
    	color: #f3f3f3;
    
		@include print {
			color: #000000;
		}
    }
\*------------------------------------*/
@mixin print {

	@media print {
		@content;
	}
	
}
