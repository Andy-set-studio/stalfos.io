    MODE
    
    This simple mixin allows you to fence css into particular sections.
    For example: you may have an admin area. The admin area uses the global
    styles but also has its own. You'd create a new file in your 'project'
    directory called 'admin.scss'. In there you would set '$mode: "admin"'. 

    Within your components etc. you would then do the following: 

    .a-css-class {
    	
    	// This stuff will only render in admin.css
    	@include mode("admin") {
			background: red;
    	}
    }
\*------------------------------------*/
@mixin mode($mode) {
	@if($output-mode == $mode) {
		@content;
	}
}
