## Stalfos
Stalfos is an open-source, skeletal front-end development starter kit. It provides a solid starting-point and framework for working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also provides tools for working with images, fonts and SVG.

Along with being a useful starter kit, Stalfos is completely modifiable and extendable which allows you to use it to create a powerful front-end development workflow. This is mainly because the core of Stalfos is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) which provides a modular task based processing system.
